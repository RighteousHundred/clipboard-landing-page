## My process

### Useful resources

- [Prepros](https://www.prepros.io) - I used Prepros in this project to compile my SCSS and make a live browser preview for me. This is a very effective tool that I would look forward to exploring.
- [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com) - Tabnine is an A.I. code autocompletion tool. It's awesome because it saved me a lot of time in the development of this project.
